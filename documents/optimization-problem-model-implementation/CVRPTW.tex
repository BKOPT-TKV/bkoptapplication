\section{Capacitated Vehicle Routing Time Windows Problem}

\subsection{Problem description}
There are $N$ delivery requests 1,2, ..., $N$. Request $i$ ($i=1,...,N$) has
\begin{itemize}
\item w(i): weight of item
\item e(i): early delivery time
\item l(i): late delivery time
\item d(i): delivery duration
\item delivery location is point i
\end{itemize}

There are $K$ trucks for delivering. Truck $k (k=1,\dots,K)$ has
\begin{itemize}
\item c(j): capacity of the truck (total weight of items on the truck cannot exceed its capacity)
\item e(j): start working time
\item l(j): end working time
\end{itemize}

-depot location is point 0

$d(i,j)$ and $t(i,j)$ are respectively distance and travel time from point $i$ to point $j$ ($i,j = 0,1,...,N$).

Objective is to minimize total distance of the routes of trucks.
\subsection{Mixed Integer Programming model}
\subsubsection{Variables}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Binary variable $X(k,i,j)\in\{0,1\}$ in which $X(k,i,j)=1$ indicates that truck $k$ traverse from point $i$ to point $j$ ($\forall k\in \{1,.\dots,K\}, i,j\in\{0,1,\dots,N\}$).
\end{itemize}
