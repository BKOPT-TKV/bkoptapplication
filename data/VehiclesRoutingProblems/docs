The problem considers multiple vehicles and multiple locations
All vehicles depart from the depot 0 and turn back to the depot after their own trip
Each vehicle has limited loading capacity, limited total trip distance and must turn back to the depot no later than a given timeline
Each location has its demand and it takes time to load the goods onto the container
Each location has its time window and a vehicle must enter and load the goods within that time window

MIP model:
V is the number of vehicles, N is number of locations
x[i][j][v] is a binary variable, which indicates whether vehicle v travels from location i to location j
If vehicle v travels to location i, s[i][v] is the time at which vehicle v reach to i
0. SUM[i](x[i][j]) means (x[0][j] + x[1][j] + x[2][j] + ... )
1. SUM[j](SUM[v](x[0][j][v])) <= V
2. SUM[i](SUM[v](x[i][0][v])) <= V
3. SUM[j](SUM[v](x[i][j][v])) = 1, i=1,2,..N-1, i!=j
4. SUM[i](SUM[v](x[i][j][v])) = 1, j=1,2,..N-1, i!=j
5. SUM[i](x[i][j][v]) = SUM[i](x[j][i][v]), j=0,1,2,..N-1, v=0,1,2,..V-1, i!=j
6. SUM[i](SUM[j](d[i][j]*x[i][j][v])) <= q[v], v=0,1,2,..V-1, i!=j
7. SUM[i](SUM[j](w[j]*x[i][j][v])) <= c[v], v=0,1,2..V-1, i!=j
8. s[i][v] + u[i] + t[i][j] <= s[j][v] + M(1-x[i][j][v]), i=0..N-1, j=1..N-1, v=0,1..V-1
9. s[i][v] + u[i] + t[i][j] >= s[j][v] - M(1-x[i][j][v]), i=0..N-1, j=1..N-1, v=0,1..V-1
10. s[j][v] + u[j] + M(x[i][j][v] -1) <= ub[j], i=0..N-1, j=1..N-1, v=0,1..V-1
11. s[j][v] - M(x[i][j][v] -1) >= lb[j], i=0..N-1, j=1..N-1, v=0,1..V-1
12. s[i][v] + t[i][0] + u[i] + M(x[i][0][v] - 1) <= tb[v], i=0..N-1, v=0..V-1
---
Constraint (1) ensures that at most, V vehicle(s) depart from the depot 0
Constraint (2) ensures that at most, V vehicle(s) turn back to the depot 0
Constraint (3) assures that exactly one vehicle leaves from location i
Constraint (4) assures that exactly one vehicle enter to location j
Constraint (5) assures that if vehicle v enter to location j, v must also depart from j
Constraint (6) assures that total trip distance of vehicle v not exceed its maximum trip distance
Constraint (7) assures that total loading of vehicle v not exceed its capacity
Constraint (8)(9) assure that if a vehicle travels to j after i, the service start time for location j = the service start time for location i
																										 + time for loading goods onto container at i
																										 + time to go from i to j
Constraint (10)(11) assure that a vehicle must enter and finish loading goods within the time window (a location is open and can load goods just in that time)
Constraint (12) assures that a vehicle must turn back to the depot no later than a given timeline.

Input:
First line contains v = the number of vehicles
Next v lines: each line contains the maximum loading capacity, maximum trip distance and the timeline that the vehicle must turn back to the depot no later than
Next line contains n = the number of locations
Next n lines: each line contains the demand and time-cost for loading that goods demand onto the container
Next n lines: distances matrix
Next n lines: time matrix
Next n lines: time windows
