The problem consider multiple vehicles and multiple location
All vehicles depart from the depot 0 and turn back to depot after their own trip
Each vehicle has limited loading capacity, limited total trip distance and must turn back to the depot no later than a given timeline
Each location has its demand and it takes time to load the goods onto the container
Each location has its time window and a vehicle must enter and load the goods within that time window
Input:
First line contains v = the number of vehicles
Next v lines: each line contains the maximum loading capacity, maximum trip distance and the timeline that the vehicle must turn back to the depot no later than
Next line contains n = the number of location
Next n lines: each line contains the demand and time-cost for loading that goods demand onto the container
Next n lines: distances matrix
Next n lines: time matrix
Next n lines: time windows
